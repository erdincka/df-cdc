# Demo CDC Capabilities using Kafka Connect and Debezium


## ‚úÖ What You Can Achieve with NiFi for CDC

NiFi supports **MySQL CDC** via the `Capture Changes MySQL` processor (part of the [**Apache NiFi Extensions**](https://nifi.apache.org/extensions/)). This processor allows you to:

- **Monitor a MySQL database for changes** (inserts, updates, deletes).
- **Stream these changes in real-time** without relying on log files or binary logs (though it‚Äôs not as performant as using binlog via Debezium).
- **Route the data to Kafka**, a file system, another database, or any other destination.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Build a CDC Pipeline with NiFi

### 1. **Install and Configure the MySQL CDC Processor**

- The `Capture Changes MySQL` processor is part of the **Apache NiFi Extensions** project.
- You need to:
  - Download the **NiFi Extension NAR** for MySQL CDC.
  - Install it into your NiFi instance (via `nifi.properties` or through the NiFi UI under *Extensions*).

### 2. **Set Up a Connection to Your MySQL Database**

- Use the `Capture Changes MySQL` processor and configure:
  - **Database URL**: e.g., `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database`
  - **Username and Password**
  - **Table or Schema** you want to monitor
  - **Polling Frequency** (how often NiFi checks for changes)
- Note: This is a **polling-based approach**, which may not be as performant or reliable as using MySQL's binary logs (as Debezium does).

### 3. **Route the Changes to Kafka**

- Use the `PutKafka` processor:
  - Configure it with your Kafka broker details.
  - Set a **topic name** for the CDC events.
- This will push all captured changes into Kafka.

## üì¶ Example NiFi Flow

```
[Capture Changes MySQL] ‚Üí [Update Attribute (optional)] ‚Üí [PutKafka]
```

- `Capture Changes MySQL`: Captures changes from your MySQL database.
- `Update Attribute` (optional): For transforming the payload, adding metadata, or routing to multiple topics.
- `PutKafka`: Sends the change events to a Kafka topic.

## üìä Comparison: NiFi vs. Kafka Connect + Debezium

| Feature | **NiFi (with Capture Changes MySQL)** | **Kafka Connect + Debezium** |
|--------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **CDC Mechanism** | Polls MySQL (less performant)         | Uses MySQL Binlog (high performance) |
| **Configuration Complexity** | Moderate (visual setup)               | Moderate (REST API or CLI)     |
| **Tooling & Ecosystem** | Rich UI, low-code approach           | Part of Kafka ecosystem        |
| **Scalability** | Limited by polling frequency          | Highly scalable with Kafka     |
| **Transformation Capabilities** | Excellent (NiFi is strong at this)  | Requires external tools       |
| **Maintenance** | Easier with NiFi UI                  | More complex with REST APIs   |

## üöß Limitations of NiFi‚Äôs CDC Approach

- **Not binlog-based**: It polls for changes, which can be inefficient for high-volume or real-time use cases.
- **Limited MySQL Compatibility**: Only supports basic DDL and DML operations (no support for full CDC in complex scenarios).
- **No built-in schema evolution or JSON processing** (like Debezium provides).

---

## üîÑ When to Choose NiFi Over Kafka Connect + Debezium

- If you're **already using NiFi** in your stack and want a **self-contained solution**.
- For **simple data pipelines** where performance isn't a top priority.
- If you want to **transform, filter, or route data** with rich flow controls before sending to Kafka.
- In **non-production environments**, for testing or small-scale use.

---

## üîÑ When to Choose Kafka Connect + Debezium

- For **high-throughput, low-latency** CDC (especially with binlog).
- If you're already using the **Kafka ecosystem** (e.g., Kafka Streams, KSQL).
- In production environments where **reliability and performance are critical**.
- When you need **schema-aware change events** and support for **complex queries or filtering**.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

Yes, you can achieve a CDC pipeline using NiFi with the `Capture Changes MySQL` processor. It's a **solid choice for simple, visual pipelines**, but if your use case requires **high performance, binlog-based CDC, or deep integration with Kafka**, then **Kafka Connect + Debezium** is the better option.
